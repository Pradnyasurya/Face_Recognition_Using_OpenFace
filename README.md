# Face_Recognition_Using_OpenFace

The prototxt and caffemodel are used for face detection in the project. OpenFace model, which is an open source module, is used for face recognition.  

The training images have to be trained by using 'training.py'. This will generate the .pickel files. The path of these files is to be given in 'recognize.py' and the code will be able to run.
